Python code for the models of social learning ('socialLearning.py') and decision making ('decision.py')
Different experiments, including the ones shown in the paper, can be explored from 'experimentSocialLearning.py' and 'experimentDecision.py'.
To run a experiment execute from command line one of the experiment files (they will generate a CSV file with the output). If a different experiment wants to be executed change the process called from the 'main' function from 'singleRun' to one of the available ones.
